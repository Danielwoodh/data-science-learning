# data-science-learning
The aim of this repo is to collate resources and notes on various data science, data engineering, and ML engineering topics, to facilitate my continuous learning and development.

**NOTE**: Not all of these resources need to be completed fully, a deeper assessment of which resources are most suitable for my specific goals will be undertaken prior to committing to a course.
