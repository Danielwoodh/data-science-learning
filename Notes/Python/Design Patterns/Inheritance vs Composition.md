# Inheritance vs Composition in Python

<details>
<summary>üîç SUMMARY</summary>

### Summary
This note explains the concepts of inheritance and composition in Python, pivotal in software design patterns. **Inheritance** is about deriving a new class from an existing one, fostering code reuse and hierarchy. **Composition** involves building complex objects from simpler entities, promoting flexibility and decoupling. The discernment between them is crucial in Python for effective object-oriented design.

## üß© Inheritance in Python
- **Definition**: A paradigm where a new class (`child`) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (`parent`).
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Strong Relationships**: For classes where the child is a specialized form of the parent.
  - **Framework Creation**: For base frameworks that provide common functionalities to be extended by subclasses.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Code Reuse**: Reduces code duplication.
  - **Clear Hierarchy**: Simplifies understanding of the code structure.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Complexity**: Can lead to tightly coupled and complex code structures.
  - **Base Class Sensitivity**: Changes in the parent class can significantly impact child classes.

## üß± Composition in Python
- **Definition**: A design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Functional Combination**: For combining functionalities from various classes without a strict hierarchical relationship.
  - **Interchangeable Components**: Ideal when components should be easily interchangeable or independently modifiable.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Loose Coupling**: Enhances flexibility and maintainability.
  - **Independent Components**: Changes in one component have minimal impact on others.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Management Complexity**: Can result in a greater number of smaller, interconnected objects.
  - **Relationship Complexity**: The interconnections between components can become intricate.

## üìä Comparing Inheritance and Composition
- **Flexibility**: Composition offers greater flexibility through dynamic runtime compositions.
- **Coupling**: Composition fosters loose coupling, whereas inheritance can create tightly bound class hierarchies.
- **Applicability**: Inheritance is ideal for clear hierarchical structures, while composition is better for modular and interchangeable component designs.

## üìù Best Practices
- **Prefer Composition**: Composition is generally favoured for its flexibility and loose coupling.
- **Judicious Inheritance Use**: Employ inheritance for clear, hierarchical relationships that simplify rather than complicate the design.
- **Combining Approaches**: In some scenarios, strategically combining both inheritance and composition can offer the best solution.
